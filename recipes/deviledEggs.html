    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 large eggs</li>
        <li>4 slices bacon</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons finely shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mustard</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil, 
            then immediately remove from the heat. Cover the pan and let eggs stand in 
            hot water for 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove eggs from the hot water and rinse under cold running water to cool.</li>
        <li>While the eggs are standing in hot water, cook bacon in a large skillet over 
            medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes.
             Drain on paper towels, then crumble. </li>
        <li>Peel cooled eggs and cut in half lengthwise. Transfer yolks to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add mayonnaise, bacon, Cheddar, and mustard to yolks, then mash to combine. 
            Spoon egg yolk mixture into egg white halves. Serve immediately or cover 
            and refrigerate until ready to serve. </li>
    </ol>
